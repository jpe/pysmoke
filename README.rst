SmokeC
------

This project is a C binding to the Smoke library, which is a C++
library to make it simpler to create bindings for C++ libraries
in other languages. Smoke is developed by KDE developers and
currently is used in KDE to generate bindings fo Qt and KDE libraries
in various languages such as perl, ruby, lisp etc.

The SmokeC project aims to provide a C API for smoke library so
that it is simpler to interface directlty with other languages
which provide a C API without having to write C++ code.

The initial goal of the SmokeC project is to generate python bindings
for qt using smoke, which reside in the pysmoke python package.
